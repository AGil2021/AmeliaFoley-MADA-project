# Overview
Welcome to my MADA project! Below, I will outline my project submissions by part throughtout the semester. Please see the bottom section for instructions on reproducing my project. 

# Project Part 1: Proposal
My proposal for part 1 of the project can be found in the products folder (`proposal.Rmd` and `proposal.html`)

# Project Part 2: Data Wrangling and Exploration
I plan to write my project report in the style of a manuscript, so I my loading/cleaning/wrangling steps will be documented in supplementary files. 

I pulled additional data from a couple of different sources to supplement my primary data. The files where these data are loaded and processed are located in the `code/processing_code` folder, and all necessary raw data is located in `data/raw_data`. The output from the processing codes is located in `processed_data`. 

My main text output for the Project Part 2 submission is the `exploration.Rmd` file located under `code/analysis_code`. 

# Reproducing this project
